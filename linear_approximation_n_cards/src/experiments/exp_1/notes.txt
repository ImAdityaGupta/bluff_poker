We are talking about iter_99 opp_strat.pkl, so not technically using last iteration.
Best n=3, k=2 version so far.
Exploitability ~ 0.52 via current feature-set (7n+5, our moves, their moves, our cards, pair?, who_first?, bias)
Acutally got exploitability of 0.53 by getting rid of our moves features (lol)
